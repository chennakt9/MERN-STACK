# PROJECT-MERN
A complete project based on mern stack.

## front-end

using react class and functional components
Using create-react-app simplifies the start


## Backend

express a nodejs framework makes it simple
body-parser was used as a middle-ware for post requests


## Connecting frontend to backend
while frontend is running on port 3000 and backend(nodejs server) is running on port 4000
requeted data was retrived from backend using http requests
for making it work we need a middleware named cors and we can send http requests using axios in react

```
npm install cors

```
```
npm install axios

```
